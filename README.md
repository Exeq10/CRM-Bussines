# CRM-Bussines


Project developed using the following technologies: React.js, React-Router-Dom, Vite, Tailwind CSS.


Currently, it fulfills the basic functions of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), but work is being done to add more functionalities to it.



It is a CRM where you can enter customer data and record specific notes about them. Currently, it does not have a real database; it is a test version that uses the fake JSON-Server API.
